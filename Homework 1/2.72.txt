A.
	maxbytes-sizeof(val)>=0 will always return true because, since 
SizeOf() returns a value of type size_t, an unsigned integer.  When a signed
integer is operated against an unsigned one, the result will always be
of type unsigned.  Therefore, the expression will never be negative.


B.
	void copy_int(int val, void *buf, int maxbytes) {
	     if (maxbytes >= 0 && maxbytes >= sizeof(val))
	     	memcpy(buf,(void*) &val, sizeof(val));
	}
