Homework 3:

Problems 3.68 and 3.70. Submit the answers as plain ASCII text files named 3.68.txt and 3.70.txt. Briefly show your work.

One more thing. C11 allows declarations to have an alignment specifier. For example, 'int _Alignas (8) n;' acts just 
like 'int n;', except that it arranges for n's alignment to be 8 instead of the default int alignment of 4. Assuming 
the x86-64, what value does the C expression 'sizeof (struct { char a; char _Alignas (8) b; char c; })' return and why? 
Briefly explain in a plain ASCII text file _Alignas.txt.
