Q:

what value does the C expression 
     
     sizeof(struct{char a; char _Alignas(8) b; char c;});

return and why?

A:

It will return 16 bytes because the first character will be at 
byte 1, and because char b is now aligned to 8, there will be 7 bytes of
junk to make char b be at byte 8, and the last character c will then be
at byte 9, since it's alignment is still inherently 1 byte.  Since the
biggest data member of this struct takes 8 Bytes, the alignment of the whole 
struct is also 8 Bytes, so 7 bytes of junk will padd the rest of the struct.  
The sizeof() operator returns the size of the struct, therefore, returning 
16 Bytes - a multiple of the alignment.
