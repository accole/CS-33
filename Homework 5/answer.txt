	a)
		In the main thread exit(0) is directly called after pthread_create
		and therefore the thread does not wait for its peer threads to run
		to completion.  The program returns with exit code: 0 before the 
		created thread could reach the printf line.

	b)
		to fix the bug, we can replace exit(0) with pthread_join(tid, NULL)
		since pthread_join interrupts the execution of the original thread
		and waits until the specified thread terminates before running to
		completion itself. 



12.25:

	echo_cnt is thread_safe because it uses mutex synchronization to protect the
	access to global variable byte_cnt which is shared (also called semaphores).  
	echo_cnt is not reentrant, however, because according to the definition of
	reentrant, echo_cnt must not reference any global (shared) variables, which
	it does.
